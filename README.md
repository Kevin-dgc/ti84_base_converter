# ti84_base_converter
This app enables you to convert between Decimal, Hexadecimal, and binary on your TI-84 Plus CE. This app allows for signed and unsigned input and output values, and it shows what bit size the value is, 8,16,32,64, and shrinks to the lowest one that can fit your number.


[arTIfiCE](https://yvantt.github.io/arTIfiCE/), [Cesium](https://www.ticalc.org/archives/files/fileinfo/465/46574.html) or another shell, and [TI Connect](https://education.ti.com/en/products/computer-software/ti-connect-ce-sw) are needed to install and run the .8xp file

The source C++ code was compiled into a .8xp with [CEdev](https://github.com/CE-Programming/toolchain)
